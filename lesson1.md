## Lesson 1: An Introduction, and the ABCs

**Regular expressions** are extremely useful in extracting information from text such as code, log file, spreadsheets, or even documents. And while there is a lot of theory behind formal languages, the following lessons and examples will explore the more practical uses of regular expressions so that you can use them as quickly as possible.
